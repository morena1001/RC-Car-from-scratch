# RC-Car-from-scratch

This project will attempt to create an RC car from scratch. This means everything from the hardware, electrical, and firmware will be personally developed. This includes vehicle systems like the driveshaft, steering rods, frame, and outer shell; electrical components like a blue pill MCU, motors, H Bridge DC Stepper, and software that will be embedded into the MCU to control the entire system.

This project aims to teach me about modeling physical items in 3D modeling software, as well as teach me about RC cars and vehicles in general work. 

The physical components of the car are going to be 3D printed, the electrical components are sourced from online websites, and the software will be developed by myself, along with online documentation and resources. 

A future, optional update will be a joystick that will control the RC car via either bluetooth (HC-06) or wifi (ESP32).
